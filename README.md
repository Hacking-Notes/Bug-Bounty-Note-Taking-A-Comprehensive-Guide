# Collaborative Note-Taking Guide & Tools for Bug Bounty Hunting

![New Project (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50310567-9135-4f51-9d9a-6258e88e0b3d)

hello, this is a summary of the description of the tool

**Requirements:**
- Create a [Proton account](https://proton.me/support/set-up-proton-drive)
- Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- Add the [Obsidian Burp Suite extension](https://github.com/Hacking-Notes/collaborative-note-taking-guide-bug-bounty-tools/blob/main/Obsidan_BurpSuite.py) to your Burp extension
- Install a PeerDraft plugin on obsidian
- Purchase an annual membership for the [Obsidian plugin](https://www.peerdraft.app/) ---> (~20$/YEAR) **NOT REQUIRED IF COLLABORATION IS NOT OF INTEREST TO YOU**

## Metodologie

The methodology for using the Burp Suite extension involves importing the targetâ€™s structure into your Obsidian file. The extension automatically adds all domains within the scope to Obsidian and updates them as needed. Within Obsidian, you should document all relevant information for each website path and link these findings to a main file where you briefly describe each issue or noteworthy detail. This approach facilitates organized note-taking and avoids the inefficiency of consolidating all information into a single file, making it easier to retrieve specific details later.
